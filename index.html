<h6 id="authored-by-kyle-estes-">** Authored by Kyle Estes **</h6>
<p>This form is the primary documentation for working with Tiger Launcher. The purpose of this document is to clearly detail install procedures and options available to the Launcher.</p>
<h2 id="install-process">Install Process</h2>
<h3 id="step-oneoptional--remove-previous-tigertrack-installs"><strong>Step One(Optional) : Remove Previous TigerTrack installs</strong></h3>
<p>For an optumium install experience, Removing old tiger track installs is advised. However it is not absolutely necessary except for the case of older Tiger Track installs (prior to v2.1)</p>
<h3 id="step-two--install-tiger-track-launcher"><strong>Step Two : Install Tiger Track Launcher</strong></h3>
<p>After clicking the setup file you may see a popup to install DotNet 6 Runtimes. Ensure this goes successfully. If there are any issues you can get the latest runtimes from <a href="https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/6.0">here</a>. <strong>Ensure you install x86 AND x64 THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT</strong></p>
<h3 id="step-three--select-application"><strong>Step Three : Select Application</strong></h3>
<p>After installing Tiger Launcher it should auto start and you should see a program selection screen. (If Tiger Launcher didnt autostart you can find it in the start menu <strong>It will not create a desktop icon by design</strong>) You should click the program you are trying to install. It will proceed to install said application and create shortcuts for the users.</p>
<h3 id="step-four--start-program"><strong>Step Four : Start Program</strong></h3>
<p>Start the installed program by double clicking the newly created desktop shortcut(refer to the Possible Issues section if you cannot locate the new desktop shortcut). During the first startup you should see dependencies being installed. If anything appears to go wrong, You may close launcher and try again. If the problem persist, you can manually install the dependencies listed <a href="https://tcsidevtools.github.io/TigerLauncher.Doc/dependencies.html">here</a></p>
<h3 id="step-five--install-deployment-tool"><strong>Step Five : Install Deployment tool</strong></h3>
<p>Find the deployment tool provided with the launcher (it should end with <code>.msi</code>) and install it. After clicking you will not see any popups or anything that validates that it did install successfully. You should pull up installed programs in control panel to ensure that it did install correctly.</p>
<h2 id="logs">Logs</h2>
<p>Tiger Launcher logs every startup event for the last 30 days on a rolling basis. You can find the logs at <code>%PROGRAMDATA%/TigerCorrectionalService/TigerLauncher/Logs</code>. <strong>ANY BUG REPORT MADE SHOULD INCLUDE THE LOGS</strong></p>
<h2 id="command-line-arguments">Command Line Arguments</h2>
<p><code>/d /debug</code><br>
You can start tiger launcher in debug mode to see more detailed information in the UI print out. <strong>Note:</strong> You will not see anymore information then is printed in the logs. This mostly exists to helps avoid digging into logs for smaller issues.</p>
<p><code>/allow-mismatch</code><br>
Typically launcher will scan a given facility license for the version a facility should be at. This means in Support Manager when you set a version, Launcher will enforce that a facility is on that version by uninstalling incorrect versions and installing correct ones. However with this command line it will skip this behavior and allow the program to start normally.</p>
<p><code>/tigertrack</code> OR <code>/dispatch</code><br>
Any program that is launcher capable will have its own argument. Providing this argument simply tells launcher what program to start.</p>
<p><code>/settings</code><br>
This argument tells launcher to open its settings page. This is typically hidden from end users but will allow you to diagnose issues with licenses as well as reattempting to add shortcuts or manually uninstalling/installing a program</p>
<h2 id="possible-issues">Possible Issues</h2>
<p>Most of the typical issues you should run into will boil down to external factors not specific to the launcher.  For example, If the facility being upgraded has an internet outage during an upgrade, Theres not much launcher can do as it cannot get the upgrade files from the blob storage.</p>
<p>Apart from internet issues, There are a few user error issues that can happen in which the launcher will not work.</p>
<h3 id="blob-storage-naming-issues">Blob storage naming issues</h3>
<p>When placing upgrade files, The naming in the blob storage is extremely important. You should find the following structure within the blobstorage itself (<strong>TigerTrack example</strong>)</p>
<p><code>tigertrack-prod -&gt; {version number} -&gt; client -&gt; {Update Files}</code><br>
In this structure there are a few things to keep in mind, {version number} should be a 3 part version number with <strong>NO LETTERS ALLOWED</strong>. So <strong>2.4.0</strong> is a valid version, <strong>2.4.0.0</strong> or <strong>2.4.0b</strong> is not and launcher will not work with this.</p>
<p>{ Update Files } should be the three following files (<strong>2.4.0 example</strong>)<br>
<code>RELEASES</code> <code>TigerTrack-2.4.0-full.nupkg</code> <code>TigerTrackSetup.exe</code></p>
<h3 id="corrupted-legacy-installers">Corrupted legacy installers</h3>
<p>Another potential issue that may come up is if the client being installed happens to ever have an older broken tiger track/tiger dispatch installed. Fixing this issue will mean cleaning up registry entries. You may try programs similar to CCleaner as it will typically go through the registry and clean any broken entries.</p>
<p>There are three places Launcher will look at for these registry entries. You may also use <code>regedit.exe</code> to manually look at these places to find if there are indeed duplicate/broken TigerTrack entries.</p>
<p><code>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Uninstall</code><br>
<code>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\UninstalL</code><br>
<code>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Wow6432Node\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Uninstall</code></p>
<p>Launcher will look at every registry entry in these folders and see if any of them have a key named “DisplayName” which would be set equal to “TigerTrack”. If you run into this problem, Typically launcher will inform you of the broken registry entry, You can use this information to manually delete the entry yourself. However some care should be taken when deleting registry entries as it can corrupt windows fairly easily. If you are not comfortable with this risk, Please get someone else involved rather then trying to fix it yourself.</p>
<h3 id="desktop-shortcuts-werent-created">Desktop shortcuts werent created</h3>
<p>In very extreme cases, Desktop shortcuts may not be generated automatically. Should you run into this issue you can try the following things.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Run launcher from the cli with the <code>/settings</code> argument. Once it opens, find the application that needs the desktop shortcut and click <strong>Create Shortcuts</strong> button.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You may also manually create the shortcut by finding the TigerLauncher executable (<strong>typically installed at /appdata/local/TigerLauncher</strong>) Right click on the executable and create a shortcut on the desktop. You can then go to that created shortcut, Click Properties, On the Shortcut Tab find the input field named <strong>Target</strong> and then add <code>/la-started</code> <code>/tigertrack</code> to the end of the target. You can then click to start it and it should update the icon from there.</p>
</li>
